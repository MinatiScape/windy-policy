    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: October 13, 2024</p>

    <p>At Windy Weather App ("we", "us", or "our"), accessible at <a href="https://github.com/techyminati/windy" target="_blank">GitHub Windy Repo</a>, we are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This page outlines our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and sensitive data when you use our service.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Windy Weather App does not collect any personal or sensitive user data. If we decide to collect such data in the future, we will ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no data usage at this time. Should this change, we will update this policy accordingly.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose any personal or sensitive user data with third parties. If this policy changes, we will inform users through the app and provide updates to this privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use appropriate measures to protect any data associated with the app. However, since no personal data is collected, we primarily focus on the security of the app infrastructure. While we strive to secure the app, no system is entirely foolproof.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>As we do not collect or store user data, no data retention or deletion policy is currently applicable. If we introduce data collection in the future, we will inform users and provide a clear data retention and deletion policy.</p>

    <h2>6. Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>Windy Weather App may contain links to third-party websites or services. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these third-party sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before engaging with them.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our service is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may revise this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage users to review the policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>
